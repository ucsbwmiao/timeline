> For me, love is love, it has nothing to do with location, time and weather... It's just a feeling that my heart is occupied by someone, and always. Even though separated by 6,401 miles physically, we are persistently entangled through such feeling.
>
> It's so hard to choose a love song. Enjoy this one~
